Important!

DevCon.London is a gathering of developers in London that aims at discussing the technical topics we all love.

We want to create a core team of members with people we know and trust that will fuel this new initiative.

There is only one rule: to be part of the core team you need to receive an invitation from someone who is already part of it, and this is yours!

After you have compiled the form, please allow 24hrs before you will be able to have access to our shared resources and communicate with other fellows.

You will also be able to introduce other people, just please discuss the new membership with the fellow who invited you beforehand.

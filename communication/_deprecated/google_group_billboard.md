# Welcome everybody! Here is our group etiquette.

## What is DevCon.London for?

- a network of trusted professional mainly working in digital productions and advertising agencies keen on discussing the topics we all love.
- a mailing list open to discussions mainly around technical topics, involving the experts collective brain that will hopefully spring a fresh approach to collaboration and sharing
- periodical events (roughly every 4-6 weeks) to bring experts together and share knowledge, experiences and opinions around topics brought up by the members of this list
- a private google doc containing all member details to allow people to connect: http://goo.gl/T7wuuG

## Who should I invite?

referral based ongoing - invite awesome people who you believe can both give and get value to the group. Ask yourself: will they contribute both via the mailing list and at events? do they have specific knowledge that is useful? Are they in a relevant role with relevant experience?

## How do I invite someone?  

Make them aware that we are looking for contribution as well as benefit. If they are keen to join, introduce them (with a one-paragraph bio) to the other fellow who introduced you to this list. Then add them to the shared spreadsheet and google group (or ask Thomas + Silvio if you don't have enough rights to do so)

## What should I use the mailing list for?

- Recommendations for support
- Specific issues which have a broad application and so are relevant to many people
- Discussion - eg: what do people think of x idea, has anyone tried using x
- Sharing interesting links

Mailing list etiquette:

- Make sure emails are relevant for many, and similarly use common sense for when to answer directly vs reply to forum.
- Direct discussions should be taken off-thread 1:1 or into a smaller list of people. Avoid banter escalations.
- Standard questions - ideally use search functionality or revive old threads so we don’t see the same topics repeated.  Also use Google to answer simple questions before putting them to the group!

## What’s the deal with the events?

The events are in theory every 5 weeks, randomly picked between a casual session at the pub and an organised event with an agenda that is relevant to all.  Events are central to the group - they offer networking, a lot of excellent advice is shared on a relevant topic, and knowing the group in person make the mailing list a more trusted and effective platform, so please try to attend at least some events.

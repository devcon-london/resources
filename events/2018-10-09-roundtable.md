## Open Discussion Points

Sign-up process remains cumbersome

Burden of admin falling on Silvio and Thomas

- #devcon-help happy to help
- Concerns raised over existing GDPR liabilities

How do we manage profiles/membership?

- Keep Google Sheet?
- Slack Profiles?
- Github?

How do we vet applicants?
- Non-developers beginning to join
- Unsolicited sales messages

Software selection

- slack integration with forum-like tool
- easy to use github auth with members page on website? maybe the forum itself with plugin?
- what infrastructure is needed to run a minimal tool set?

Paid Slack remains a contentious topic

- Integrate with Discourse?

Preferred structure and direction of DevCon still unclear

- Formal organisation vs informal community
- Desire to not disrupt what works
- Guild
  - Could/should we splinter?
  - Tiers managed with software?

# Devcon London | Code of Conduct

## Community

Devcon London is a network of trusted professionals working in digital productions keen on discussing the topics we all love.

Your voice is always welcome. It's natural to feel intimidated when posting to a group of peers as large as Devcon London. Even if you’re lurking, your presence is appreciated!

## Origin

The Devcon London mailing list was originally created in London in 2015 to meet and build a professional network of trusted people. Over time the community was grown and evolved to became a resource for technical knowledge and job/gig listings. 

## Rules

1. **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:
    - Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
    - Threats of violence
    - Deliberate intimidation
    - Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Stalking or following
    - Any other kind of harassment
2. **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
3. **Be encouraging.** Share your knowledge. Prop up those who need support. Go out of your way to support and mentor those who are unseen or unheard.
4. **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. Be mindful of sarcasm and snark that detract from or derail the conversation in a negative way. Trolling and personal attacks are forbidden.
5. **Be exemplary and remember the person**. When you communicate to other people on this list, you must ask yourself “Would I say this to the person's face in front of a group of my respected peers, mentors, teachers, and students?”
6. **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.
7. **Keep it on-topic.** Consider if what you say serves the intent of the original post. If not, create a new thread.
8. **Speak up.** If you see bad behavior, please call it out and contact one of the moderators.
